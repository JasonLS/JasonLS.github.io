								<h2> A little bit about myself.</h2>
							</header>
							<p> Hello, I am a growing software developer who is looking to get further within the embedded technology field. I have already found my passion and am looking for a well-respected company to increase my programming skills to present better solutions to my employers and their clients. Out of high school, I got a full-time job at a company that worked with my school club which I also mentor for. Three years ago, the journey began with that club, R.E.S.T which stands for Roseville Engineering Science and Technology. Our first team project was building an underwater remote operated vehicle.  After this first project, I took on a leadership role with software programming and was asked by various teams for my time and talent. In 2018 I began an internship at Beagleboard where I decided I loved embedded Linux. I created a small game for Makerfaire 2018 New York. This project utilizes a 16X16 LED matrix and was written in C++.  The link to this project is found below. Along with this, I wrote all the software for our club's autonomous power wheels jeep that is detailed below. My current job is as a software developer for my current company, GHIElectronicsto. I also write blogs and maintain the forum too. I am always searching for potential avenues to gain more knowledge so please contact me. My contact info is at the bottom of my website.

								<h2>My interests</h2>
							</header>

							<p><b>Music</b></p>
							<p>If I'm not researching or working on new projects about programming, I am usually playing bass guitar or using ROLI software to create my own music. While I don't plan on getting any college degrees for music, I like to incorperate my musical talent into writing software to help with beginning musicians.  </p>

							<p><b>Gaming</b></p>
							<p>My favorite pastime growing up is gaming. While most see it has childish and a waste of time, I discovered the benefits of it on my childhood.  One of the core mechanics in most games are problem solving. The player is given a problem and they have to break it down, look at what they have, make a plan and solve the problem then move on to the next. This is a skill i think most people lack when dealing with problems. They take off more then they can chew and rush to meet deadlines instead of proper planning.
